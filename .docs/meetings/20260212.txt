1. Game Structure and Business Model
• Shift to Monthly Seasons: Instead of a 3-month commitment or an endless game, the project will operate on 1-month "seasons". This allows for a sense of urgency (scarcity) and makes it easier for users to commit financially.
• Elimination of Free Trial: The team decided to remove the "free trial week." Users must pay from day one. This avoids complications with refunds and ensures users understand what they are buying immediately.
• Pricing: The price remains 100 NIS per month.
• Sales Cycle: Registration for the next season will open roughly three weeks before the start date, with prices increasing as the date approaches (e.g., starting at 80 NIS, rising to 100 NIS).
2. Technical and Platform Changes (MVP)
• Bot-Centric Flow: The team decided to remove the external landing page to reduce friction. All interactions—from description to registration and payment—will happen directly through the Telegram Bot.
• Simplifying Channels: To avoid confusing users, they will remove the Telegram Channel and keep only the Bot (for the game) and the Group (for community chat).
• Questionnaire: The intake questionnaire will be integrated directly into the Bot (or a Mini App within Telegram) rather than being a separate external document/form.
• Deployment: Masha and Yura will focus on getting the production environment ready and deploying deployment scripts immediately.
3. Content and Marketing Strategy
• Tone Shift: Content (posts/videos) must shift from a complex, "literary" style to a simple, conversational tone ("speak with words through your mouth") that directly addresses the audience's pain points (loneliness) rather than just the author's internal reflections.
• Engagement: Posts should break the "fourth wall" and ask questions to provoke interaction (e.g., "Press a button if you are lonely," "Tell us your city").
• Campaigns:
    ◦ Valentine's Day: Run a contest for the funniest bad date story or interactive "send a valentine" post to boost engagement.
    ◦ Purim: A costume contest where the winner gets a free month of the game.
• Influencers: Margo will focus on contacting influencers (bloggers like Zhukovsky) and partners rather than just posting in free groups.
4. Timeline
• Internal Testing: Immediate start (approx. Feb 13–18) for 5 days of internal technical testing.
• Beta Testing: Starting February 18th, the 65 people currently on the waiting list will act as beta testers for one week (free) to find bugs.
• Official Launch: The paid game/first season is scheduled to start on March 15th.
5. Visual Identity
• Logo & Style: The team agreed to create a professional logo and consistent visual style (colors, headers) to build trust. They leaned toward a "sea wave" (teal/blue-green) color palette. Margo is responsible for finding a designer or using AI tools like Ideogram
